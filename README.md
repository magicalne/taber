Taber is a chrome extension to switch tabs in a popup. Especially in **fullsecreen mode**.   

### Why taber?   

Well, everyone who use chrome browser know that there is a fullsecreen mode in the browser. But it seems that we don't use it a lot in our daily life. Maybe just for some pages, you want to make it looks larger. Because when you in fullscreen mode, you feel that it's less convenient than the usual mode -- you lose the control of the tabs.   

You can't navigate web pages between different tabs. Of course you can switch beteen the tabs with chrome shortcuts, like **cmd-1** to **cmd-9**. But when you open too many tabs, which I usually do, what can you do now.   

With **Taber** you can locate your tab with keyword (based on the web page title) very fast. And it supports fuzzy match. If there is no match, taber will create a new tab and search it for you with google.
